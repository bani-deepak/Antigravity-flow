    question: "Why wouldn't I just hire a full-time designer?",
    answer: "Good question! For starters, the annual cost of a full-time senior-level designer now exceeds $100,000, plus benefits (and good luck finding one available). Aside from that, you may not always have enough work to keep them busy at all times, so you're stuck paying for time you aren't able to utilize. With the monthly plan, you can pause and resume your subscription as often as you need to ensure you're only paying your designer when you have work for them."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a limit to how many requests I can have?",
    answer: "Once subscribed, you're able to add as many design requests to your queue as you'd like, and they will be delivered one by one (or two by two on the Pro plan)."
  },
  {
    question: "How fast will I receive my designs?",
    answer: "On average, most requests are completed in just two days or less. However, more complex requests can take longer."
  },
  {
    question: "Who is the designer?",
    answer: "You'll work directly with me, founder of BANI. This means you'll work directly with an expert, rather than an anonymous junior designer."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't like the design?",
    answer: "No worries! We'll continue to revise the design until you're 100% satisfied."
